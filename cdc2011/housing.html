  <p>In the past, we have had many people request housing, and only a few people utilize the housing provided by our team.  We have decided to ask for a $10 down payment, per person, for housing to encourage people to utilize their housing arrangements.  The money is non-refundable, and will be considered a donation towards scholarships at CDC 2011.</p>
  
  <p>Even though we try to get visiting teams sleeping space, we recommend getting a hotel room to share. Hotels near campus are very affordable so instead of travelling 30 minutes to the host house, it might be worth sharing a room with your friends.</p>

  <p>Whether you are a competitor, social dancer, or dance spectator here is a great opportunity to offer your hospitality to our dance community. If you have space available in your home to provide weekend housing for traveling competitors please let us know.</p>
