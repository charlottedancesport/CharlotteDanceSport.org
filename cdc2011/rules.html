<h3 id="r">Restrictions</h3>

<ul class="newcomer_ul">
  <li>Dancers may compete in two consecutive levels for a particular dance/style (Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Novice, Pre-champ, Champ). 
All dancers, above the newcomer level, may also dance in the Open Novice International Viennese Waltz and Open Novice International Paso Doble Category.</li>
  <li>Same-sex couples are allowed ONLY in newcomer and bronze events.</li>
  <li>Only open level dancers and Gold level dancers may compete in the Open Mixed Proficiency level.
If a person is competing at an Open Proficiency level event, they may not dance at Newcomer or Bronze Mixed Proficiency level events.</li>
</ul>

<ul><li><a class="top" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<h3 id="l">Levels (Amateurs only)</h3>

<p>Level eligibility during this competition is in accordance with the <a href="http://www.sco.uncc.edu/dance/cdc/ycn_proficiency_points_rules.htm" title="Youth College Network" target="_blank">Youth College Network (YCN)</a> and <a href="http://usadance.org/dancesport/forms-and-resources/rules-policies-and-bylaws/" title="USA Dance proficiency points" target="_blank">USA Dance</a> proficiency points system, with the additional restriction that individual bronze events are open only to dancers with 2 years or less of dance experience. This competition is open to AMATEURS ONLY.</p>

<ul class="newcomer_ul"><li><strong>Newcomer</strong> Started dancing no earlier than August 2009.</li></ul>
<ul class="bronze_ul"><li><strong>Bronze</strong> Only Bronze steps may be danced. Started dancing no earlier than April 2008.</li></ul>
<ul class="silver_ul"><li><strong>Silver</strong> Only Bronze and Silver steps may be danced.</li></ul>
<ul class="gold_ul"><li><strong>Gold</strong> Only Bronze, Silver, and Gold steps may be danced.</li></ul>
<ul><li class="novice_li"><strong>Open Novice, Pre-Champ and Championships</strong> Open figures permitted and encouraged.</li></ul>
<ul class="fun_ul"><li><strong>Fun Dances</strong> All levels allowed.</li></ul>
<h3 id="cp">Clarifying Points</h3>

<ul class="newcomer_ul">
<li>In order for a couple to be eligible to dance at a level, BOTH the dancers in the couple must meet the requirements. For instance, if Jack can do bronze standard, but Jill is placed out of bronze standard, they CANNOT dance at bronze standard.</li>
<li>Your points earned at any other competitions (USABDA or collegiate) do constitute toward your YCN points.</li>
<li>You earn points as a dancer, and not as a leader or follower. If Jill placed out of silver latin while dancing as a follower, she cannot dance silver latin even as a leader, unless the competition rules say so explicitly.</li>
<li>If you took a break from dancing, you can simply take out that much of time while looking at eligibility by time, but you should not start over.</li>
<li>Placing out using points is per-dance basis. It may be possible that you placed out of silver waltz, but not silver tango. In that case, you can dance silver tango, but not silver waltz. If you are placed out of more than half of the dances in a level for a style, consider dancing up for all the dances of that style.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sy">Syllabi</h3>

<ul class="newcomer_ul">
  <li>We will be using the <a href="http://www.usistd.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=51" title="ISTD & USISTD syllabi" target="_blank">ISTD &amp; USISTD syllabi</a>.</li>
  <li>We comply with latest version of <a href="USA Dance dress code" title="USA Dance Rulebook" target="_blank">USA Dance Rulebook</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Charlotte DanceSport Challenge is <strong>not a sanctioned USA Dance or ISTD event</strong>.  However, in the spirit of Amateur dancing, and leveling the playing field, we have decided to adopt the USA Dance Rulebook and posted Syllabus so that we might develop more towards other mainstream amateur competitions.  It is not the intent of the CDC organizers to overwhelmingly enforce the subtle differences between the various posted syllabi.  As long as the <strong>intent</strong> of a Bronze, Silver, or Gold syllabus choreography is up held, we are willing to accept (but do not promote or encourage) the use of alternate syllabi.  Final decisions and dispute resolutions will be at the sole discretion of the CDC organizers, without exception.</p>

<ul><li><a class="top" >&and; top</a></li></ul>

<h3 id="c">Costumes</h3>

<ul class="newcomer_ul">
  <li>Syllabus events: No costumes allowed. Dress code must be adhered to.</li>
  <li>Open events: Costumes allowed &amp; encouraged.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the intent of the 2011 CDC to uphold the newest <a href="http://usadance.org/dancesport/forms-and-resources/rules-policies-and-bylaws/" title="USA Dance dress code" target="_blank">USA Dance dress code</a>.  There should be adequate time to prepare for these updated costume rules, and again we are attempting to develop this event to parallel typical USA Dance events.  Exceptions to the posted USA Dance costuming rules will be at the sole discretion of the CDC organizers and will NOT be granted except in very rare instances or <strong>emergency costume situations</strong>.</p>

<ul><li><a class="top" >&and; top</a></li></ul>
